						<p class="m-0">Once the doctors have decided that donor and recipient are fit to undergo the surgery and permission has been granted for the same by the competent authority/ authorization committee, a day will be fixed for the live donor transplant operation. The patient and the donor have to get admitted to the hospital at least 48 hours before the operation.  It's mandatory that both patient and the donor again undergo tissue or lymphocyte cross match test to make sure that the kidney recipient has not formed any antibodies to donor tissues at this stage. One has to understand that these antibodies can appear at any time even if they were not detected at the time of preliminary tests.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Before surgery, the donor and the recipient along with their immediate family members will be counseled again regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the kidney transplant. One can still decide to undergo the operation or reject at this stage also. The process of counseling and consent for the surgery will be video graphed and documented.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 py-4">
					<p>Patient and the family should understand that kidney transplant surgery is not a 100% successful surgery. Five to ten percent of kidneys may not work and patient has to go back on dialysis immediately, or with in short time due to nonfunctioning of the transplanted kidney. The rejected or nonfunctioning kidney cannot be putback to the donor under usual circumstances.</p>
					<hr>
					<p>The donor and the recipient will be operated upon simultaneously by team of doctors. The kidney removed from the donor will be handed over to the team of doctors operating the kidney recipient immediately, and the kidney will be attached to blood vessels in the lower part of the abdomen as shown in the figure below</p>
